# POS_Entropy_Chinese
Calculates the part of speech (POS) entropy of given Chinese text. This entropy measures how flexible Chinese words are used for different POS within the text. Such flexibility is considered by some to be the sign of Western influence on the modern Chinese language.
The text files need to be processed first by the Stanford Chinese segmenter and POS tagger.
